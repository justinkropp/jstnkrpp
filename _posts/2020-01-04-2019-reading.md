title: 2019 Notable Reads
excerpt: 2019 was a year of reading for me, and I'd like to share some particular reads that I'd consider standouts.
---

This past year I made a concerted effort to read more. I wanted what I read to span a range of topics that I’m currently interested in as well as those that I’m not well versed but would like to be.

I oddly don’t read much fiction, but that's something I'd like to change for 2020. For 2019 I ended up finishing a book every couple weeks and I’m hoping to double that number for 2020. Below are a few standouts for 2019 that I particularly enjoyed.
