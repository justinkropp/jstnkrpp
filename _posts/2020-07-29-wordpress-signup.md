    <p>WordPress is an open-source SaSS application that allows someone to quickly spin-up a blog, website, or online store. As of 2020, its software powers approximately 37% of of all sites on the web.</p>
    <p>I joined Automattic, the makers of WordPress, in 2012. During my three years at the company I worked on numerous projects across several different teams. Most notably, I worked with the New User Experience (NUX) and User Onboarding teams to tackle improving our signup flow as well as the experience a new user has once they sign up. Both efforts involved user research, user experience design, and user interface design.</p>

    <h3>Signup Flow</h3>
    <p>My initial work on the User Onboarding and Growth team involved exploring ways to help increase activation, as many of our new users were abandoning the the signup process midway through. I recruited the help of our Growth Engineering teams to help re-build a signup flow that was modular and would lend itself to quickly re-arranging the steps of the flow. This would allow testing different configurations and quickly learning which sequence performed and which didn't.</p>

    <p>Our current signup flow placed the account creation CTA at the beginning of the experience. Creating an account required little to no effort on the user's part. It was only after account creation that we began asking for further account and profile information.</p>

    <p>I led an effort to redesign a signup flow that would place the account creation at the tail end of the signup flow, with account information, product details, plan selection, and domain name selection preceding the account creation CTA. I was asking our users to invest more time and information before creating their account. I hypothesized that a greater upfront investment in time would lead to a decrease in signup flow abandonment.</p>

    <p>To help mitigate any potential information overload or option paralysis that a user might encounter during the signup flow, the domain registration contact information and payment details were presented to the user after they had activated their account but before they landed in their account dashboard.</p>
