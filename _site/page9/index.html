    <p>Once a user signed up for an account, they would land in their account dashboard. The dashboard was command central, so to speak. From here they could manage their posts, pages, and plugins. Approve or delete comments. Customize their theme. Add, delete, or change permissions for site contributors. It put the user in the driver seat.</p>
    <p>We hypothesized that if a user could view the fruits of their labor — audience engagement — that they would be more inclined to stick around and continue to create content. User researched confirmed our hunch. Statements like "Are people even reading my content?" and "Do they like what they're reading?" were heard over and over in user interviews.</p>

  <article>
    <p>As a solution to our user's frustration with not knowing if anyone was engaging with their content, we designed a robust analytics dashboard that would become the default view of the user dashboard. From here the user could quickly get a birds eye view of the traffic breakdown for their site: views, visitors, likes, and comments per day/week/month/years. </p>

  <article>
    <p>When given the ability to view traffic broken down by post, page, search term, and clicks a user can gauge which content their audience was responding to. To help aid the user in continued refinement of their site's presence online, we built a site checklist into this analytics dashboard that would provide actionable tips and tricks to help them understand how to get the most out of their site.</p>

  <article>
    <p>For users who had opted to skip setting up a domain during signup, we made sure to provide access to that upgrade from their dashboard. If a user chose to upgrade their account, we made sure that they could do so right from their dashboard and that that process kept them in their dashboard view.</p>
