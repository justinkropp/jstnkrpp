<p>I’ve spent the better part of the last several years exploring and questioning my relationship with design. This exploration has primarily been an internal exercise  and to a large intent informed by the nature of my career path: a formally educated graphic designer working as a digital product designer in tech for the past 15 years.</p>
<p>Rather than continue to keep these explorations and observations to myself, I’d like put them out there in the open and perhaps find some answers to the questions I’ve been asking.</p>
<p>All this to say that I’m redesigning my personal site in the hopes that it will serve as a decent enough place to house these observations and questions.</p>
